**What I have gained:** (☄◣ω◢)☄

Through this visit, I learnt about the services, tools and technologies provided by UTM Digital, such as UTMWifi, software systems and applications. Other than that, I gained a deep understanding of how universities are implementing digital tools to solve problems, increase efficiency and improve the learning experience. During the visit, I observed workflows, teamwork and how the industry stays digitally innovative.


**My improvement:** (； ･`д･´)

I improved my video production skills by learning to record, take photos, plan, and edit videos effectively. When making video content, I was able to summarise the information gained from the visit and present it in an engaging, simple and creative way. In addition, I enhanced my ability to translate my understanding into content that other people can easily understand.
